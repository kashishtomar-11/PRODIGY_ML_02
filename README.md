🎯 Task 02 - K-Means Clustering on Retail Store Customers

This task is part of my internship at Prodigy Infotech.

📌 Objective

Create a K-means clustering algorithm to group retail store customers based on their purchase history.

📊 Dataset Used

- Source: [Kaggle - Customer Segmentation](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python)
- File: `Mall_Customers.csv`

⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Google Colab
- Libraries: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `sklearn`
